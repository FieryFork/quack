# Quack
A port of Quake's first level for the game Bloodthief. It has been modified to allow for Bloodthief's sliding mechanics (slopes instead of stairs) to make it that little bit more fun to play. Consider forking this repository if you want to make improvements.

Use the Bloodthief mod loader to play this map: [Bloodthief Mod Loader](https://github.com/olvior/bloodthief-mod-loader). First, unzip the file. Then, drag the folder to your "Maps" folder.
